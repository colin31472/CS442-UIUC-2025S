# CS 442: Trustworthy Machine Learning (Spring 2025)

This repository contains my write-up for Homework 1–3 for CS 442 at UIUC.

---

## hw1 — Feedforward Networks, Fairness, and Matrix Calculus

- Analyzes the representational limitations of linear neural networks using the XOR problem.
- Explores fairness through statistical parity and randomized classifiers.
- Includes matrix calculus for symmetric factorization and gradient descent dynamics in linear regression.

---

## hw2 — Fairness and Adversarial Learning

- Examines statistical parity and equalized odds through theoretical and constructed examples.
- Implements adversarial training (`FairNet`) and conditional learning (`CFairNet`) on the Adult and COMPAS datasets.
- Includes analysis of fairness-accuracy trade-offs using adversarial loss scaling.

---

## hw3 — Robustness and Differential Privacy

- Explores trade-offs between standard and adversarial robustness in linear classifiers.
- Formulates MILP-based certified robustness for ReLU networks.
- Derives core properties and guarantees of differential privacy using Laplace mechanism.
